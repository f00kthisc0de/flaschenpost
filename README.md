# Flaschenpost-Bulli Fahrzeug-RÃ¼ckgabe

<b> The Flaschenpost Bully Website / Protocol </b>

This is a website we've been working on for a couple of months now and it is still in development.</br>
Its only purpose is to make the handing over of vehicles easier.<br>

So how do I use this website you might ask yourself.<br>
So lets take a look at the different assets of the website:<br>

<b>1. Choose your Car </b><br>
Normally you would choose between license plates but in this example there are 8 cars to choose from.<br>

<b>2. Choose your tool</b> <br>

As you can see, you're able to choose from 3 different tools to edit.<br>
You can mark little damages, scratches and large scale damages.<br>
Little damages will be marked with an x, scratches with a line and large scale damages with a circle.<br>

<b>3. Save</b><br>

This website automatically saves your edits.<br>
Even if you close the browser, wipe your browser cache or delete the coockies.<br>
If you click on the save button it will download a .save file which you can use <br>
as a backup or to reupload to another device which can then display all the edits you made.<br>
Which brings us to the next feature:<br>

<b>4. Uploading a .save file</b><br>

As already mentioned in step 3 you can upload .save files to display damages from a second device.<br>

<b>5. Deleting edits</b>

Of course you can delete your edits at any time by just clicking on the red cross of the specific damage you want to remove.<br>

This website was developed for tablets but can also be used on other devices like smartphones and Laptops.
